The aim of Finglonger is to help developers with minimal backend experience get the data for their websites and web apps out of their javascript or JSON files and put it in a database where it belongs. Finglonger then makes it easy to GET, UPDATE, INSERT or DELETE that content in a secure way by providing a RESTful API to interface with. So whether youâ€™re wanting to store form entries or create you own custom content management system, Finglonger has you covered.
